:type: runfiles

The runfiles for the executable's "user" dependencies. These are things in e.g.
`deps` (or similar), but doesn't include "external" or "implicit" pieces,
e.g. the Python runtime itself. It's roughly akin to the files a traditional
venv would have installed into it.
""",

:type: None | File

A symlink to build_data.txt if stamping is enabled, otherwise None.

:type: list[str]

Args that should be passed to the interpreter before regular args
(e.g. `-X whatever`).

:type: None | str

Path to the Python interpreter to use for running the executable itself (not the
bootstrap script). Either an absolute path (which means it is
platform-specific), or a runfiles-relative path (which means the interpreter
should be within `runtime_files`)

:type: File

The user-level entry point file. Usually a `.py` file, but may also be `.pyc`
file if precompiling is enabled.

:::{seealso}

The {obj}`stage2_bootstrap` attribute, which bootstraps an executable to run
the user main file.

The runfiles the program needs, but without the original executable,
files only added to support the original executable, or files specific to the
original program.

:type: File | None

The Bazel-executable-level entry point to the program, which handles Bazel-specific
setup before running the file in {obj}`main`. May be None if a two-stage bootstrap
implementation isn't being used.

:type: File | None

The `bin/python3` file within the venv this binary uses. May be None if venv
