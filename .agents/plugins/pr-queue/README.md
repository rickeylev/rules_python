# PR Queue Plugin

Side panel UI (`sidecar://pr-queue/pr_queue/`) showing pending GitHub pull
requests with buttons to launch manual code reviews in isolated Git worktrees.

## Behavior

- Displays open GitHub PRs filtered by review status, author, draft state, age,
  or custom search query using the `gh` CLI.
- Fetches on demand only: does not automatically run code reviews and does not
  automatically poll or refresh the queue or review results in the background.
- Clicking a PR review button creates or updates a dedicated Git worktree at the
  PR head commit and starts a new Antigravity conversation running
  `.agents/skills/review-code/SKILL.md`.

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or higher on `PATH`.
- Authenticated `gh` CLI (`gh auth status`) with access to the target repo.
- A local Git clone of the target repo containing an `upstream` (or `origin`)
  remote so review worktrees can be created from `refs/pull/<N>/head`.
- Global registration in `~/.gemini/config/plugins/pr-queue` (for example via a
  symlink to this directory) so Antigravity starts `pr-queue/pr_queue`.
